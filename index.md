## Overview

**Manoa Guesser** is a gamified exploration web app designed to help students at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa familiarize themselves with campus locations. Every year, UH Mānoa welcomes a new influx of students, many of whom struggle to navigate the large and diverse campus. This project aims to make the process of discovering study spots, landmarks, and hidden corners of campus both fun and engaging.

**The goal:**  
To create a campus-based guessing game that encourages exploration, connection, and familiarity with the UH Mānoa environment through friendly competition and participation.

**The system will eventually provide:**
- A guessing game where users identify locations from random photos taken around UH Mānoa.
- A points-based scoring system rewarding accuracy.
- User-submitted campus photos for community-driven content.
- Administrative moderation tools for managing photo submissions.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Guess the campus location based on a provided image.
- **Leaderboards:** Track high scores and encourage competition.
- **Photo Submission:** Users can submit their own images for review.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Moderation tools to approve or reject submitted photos.
- **Community Growth:** Connect students from various majors through shared campus experiences.
